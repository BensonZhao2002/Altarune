/*
 here's a package with the ragdolling mechanic we have so far.
we have some changes in the works in the entities that will be using the ragdoll mechanic, 
so this mechanic will be localized to its own component. 
that is, we'll be a calling a ragdoll method on this component from the entity script when the entity dies, 
all the ragdolling logic should happen inside these component.

the object is guaranteed to have a rigidbody and a velocity limiter utility 
(essentially, a component that limits the max velocity a rigidbody can reach). 
the idea is to have the object ragdoll, slow down, then sink into the ground, then destroy itself. 
the objects using this will be using sphere colliders for physical collisions.

if possible, i'd use the limiter component instead of editing the rigidbody's velocity 
directly as there are a few mechanics in the game that edit that value asynchronously
